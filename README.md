# Drug-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is based on the dataset extracted from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29
The dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10 star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction. 
The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites.

I based the project around the reviews of Levonorgestrel, a birth control drug.
This is the drug with the most entries on the dataset.
This drug also has mixed reviews, so it allowed for a more in depth sentiment analysis.

# Project Overview
•	I apply the basics of NLTK text analysis to the drug reviews
•	I use Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to categorize the reviews
•	I apply Gensim Doc2Vec to generate representation vectors
